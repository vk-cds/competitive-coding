Problem Statement: Given an array and a sum k, we need to print the length of the longest subarray that sums to k.

Example 1:
Input Format: N = 3, k = 5, array[] = {2,3,5}
Result: 2
Explanation: The longest subarray with sum 5 is {2, 3}. And its length is 2.

Example 2:
Input Format: N = 3, k = 1, array[] = {-1, 1, 1}
Result: 3
Explanation: The longest subarray with sum 1 is {-1, 1, 1}. And its length is 3.
